Bank Data Analysis in Python

This project leverages Python to analyze banking datasets, focusing on customer transactions, account activities, and financial patterns. By using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the project provides data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to uncover actionable insights.

Why itâ€™s useful:

Customer Insights: Helps banks understand customer behavior, including deposit/withdrawal patterns, loan repayments, and spending habits.

Fraud Detection Support: Identifies anomalies in transaction data that may indicate fraudulent activity.

Policy & Compliance: Automates reporting for audits and regulatory requirements, ensuring accuracy and timeliness.

Decision Support: Provides managers with clear dashboards and reports to guide policy changes, improve efficiency, and enhance customer service.

Scalability: The Python-based framework can easily be extended for predictive modeling (e.g., predicting loan defaults, customer churn).
